# Meme-Share-Android-App

It's a very simple android app, it is built using kotlin language.
To display the meme on the screen, we use an Reddit API, through which we can get random meme whenever we press the "Next" button of the app.
We can share the meme using "Share" Button, actually it sends the exact url of that particular meme, on which whoever taps, can see the meme right into the Browser.

Hope, you'll like :)
